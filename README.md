# Registration Form

## Overview
This Registration Form allows users to create an account by entering their personal details, including first name, last name, email, password, date of birth, and gender. The form incorporates validation to ensure that passwords match before submission, providing a secure and user-friendly experience.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Used for structuring the form elements, including input fields, labels, and buttons.
- **CSS**: Employed for styling the form, ensuring a clean layout and enhancing user experience with smooth animations and transitions.
- **JavaScript**: Utilized for interactive functionalities, such as validating password confirmation and handling form submission events.

## Code Concepts

### Form Structure
The form is organized into distinct sections, each containing relevant input fields:
- **First Name & Last Name**: Required fields for user identification.
- **Email**: A field for entering the user's email address, which is required for account verification.
- **Password & Confirm Password**: Fields to set and confirm the user's password, with validation to ensure they match.
- **Date of Birth & Gender**: Additional fields for demographic information.

### Form Validation
The JavaScript code handles form validation. When the form is submitted, it checks whether the password and confirm password fields match. If they do not, an alert is displayed to notify the user.

### Responsive Design
The CSS is designed to ensure the form is responsive and displays correctly on various screen sizes. Flexbox is used for layout adjustments, making the form user-friendly on both desktop and mobile devices.
